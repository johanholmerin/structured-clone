A Javascript implementation of the structured clone algorithm.

No external dependencies.

## Install

```

## Usage

```javascript
import structuredClone from '@johanholmerin/structured-clone';

const newObj = structuredClone(obj);

  synchronously make a copy.
* Copying `FileList` is only supported in browsers that support the
  `DataTransfer` constructor.
